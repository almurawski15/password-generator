# Unit 3 JavaScript: Password Generator Assignment 

## Description
This assignment helps to solve the protection of sensitive employee data, specifically user passwords. This application will provide a secure password by prompting users with certain critieria to determine a randomly generated password.

When prompted the password should meet the following criteria:

    1. The password length will be between 8 - 128 characters
    2. The password will have at least one or all of the following character types:
        * Lowercase letters
        * Uppercase letters
        * Numbers
        * Special characters
